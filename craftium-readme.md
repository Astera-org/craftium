Craftium is a fully open source research platform for Reinforcement Learning (RL) research. Craftium provides a [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html) wrapper for the [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/) voxel game engine.

**Features:**

- **Super extensible.** Minetest is built with modding in mind! The game engine is completely extensible using the [Lua](https://www.lua.org) programming language. Easily create mods to implement the environment that suits the needs of your research!

- **Modern RL API**. Craftium slightly modifies Mintest to comminicate with Python, and implements the well-known [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html)'s [Env](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/env/) API. This opens the door to a huge number of existing tools and libraries compatible with this API, such as [stable-baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io) or [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl).

- **Fully open source.** Craftium is based on the Minetest and Gymnasium, both open source projects.

- **No more Java.** The Minecraft game is writen in Java, not a very friendly language for clusters and very high performance applications. Contrarily, Minetest is written in C++, much more friendly for clusters and very high performant!
