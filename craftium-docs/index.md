Craftium is a fully open-source platform for creating Reinforcement Learning (RL) environents and tasks that provides a [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html) wrapper for the [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/) voxel game engine.

Check the [installation](./installation.md) instructions and the [getting started](./getting-started.md) pages to start using craftium!

## Features ‚ú®

- **Super extensible üß©:** Minetest is built with modding in mind! The game engine is completely extensible using the [Lua](https://www.lua.org) programming language. Easily create mods to implement the environment that suits the needs of your research! See [environments](./environments.md) for a showcase of what is possible with craftium.

- **Extensive documentation üìö:** Craftium extensively [documents](https://craftium.readthedocs.io) how to [use](./getting-started.md) existing [environments](./environments.md) and [create](./creating-envs.md) new ones. The documentation also includes a low-level [reference](./reference.md) of the exported Python classes and gymnasium [Wrappers](./wrappers.md), [extensions to the Lua API](./lua_functions.md), and [code examples](./lua_env_cookbook.md). Moreover, Craftium greatly benefits from existing Minetest documentation like the [wiki](https://wiki.minetest.net/Main_Page), [reference](https://api.minetest.net/), and [modding book](https://rubenwardy.com/minetest_modding_book/en/basics/getting_started.html).

- **Modern RL API ü§ñ:** Craftium slightly modifies Mintest to communicate with Python, and implements the well-known [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html)'s [Env](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/env/) API. This opens the door to a huge number of existing tools and libraries compatible with this API, such as [stable-baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io) or [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl).

- **Fully open source ü§†:** Craftium is based on the Minetest and Gymnasium, both open-source projects.

- **No more Java ‚ö°:** The Minecraft game is written in Java, not a very friendly language for clusters and high-performance applications. Contrarily, Minetest is written in C++, much more friendly for clusters, and highly performant!
